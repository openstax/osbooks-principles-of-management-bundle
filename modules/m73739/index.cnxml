<section id="fs-idm345727424"><title>About <emphasis effect="italics">Organizational Behavior</emphasis></title>
<para id="fs-idm357612080">The field of management and organizational behavior exists today in a constant state of evolution and change. Casual readers of publications like the New York Times, The Economist and the Wall Street Journal will learn about the dynamic nature of organizations in today’s ever-changing business environment. <emphasis effect="italics">Organizational Behavior</emphasis> is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of the introductory course on Organizational Behavior. This is a traditional approach to organizational behavior. The table of contents of this book was designed to address two main themes. What are the variables that affect how, when, where, and why managers perform their jobs? What theories and techniques are used by successful managers at a variety of organizational levels to achieve and exceed objectives effectively and efficiently throughout their careers? Management is a broad business discipline, and the Organizational Behavior course covers many areas such as individual and group behavior at work, as well as organizational processes such as communication in the workplace and managing conflict and negotiation. No one individual can be an expert in all areas of management, so an additional benefit of this text is that specialists in a variety of areas have authored individual chapters. Finally, we all made an effort to present a balanced approach to gender and diversity throughout the text in the examples used, the photographs selected, and the use of both male and female in alternating chapters when referring to generic managers or employees.</para>
<section id="fs-idm298412960"><title>Pedagogical Foundation</title>
<para id="fs-idm331075968">We have taken a structured approach in the writing of the chapters that reduces inconsistencies throughout and makes selecting topics to match the course syllabus easier for faculty.</para>
<para id="fs-idm308638768"><emphasis effect="bold">Exploring Managerial Careers.</emphasis> Each chapter starts with a profile that describes a manager and illustrates how the content of the chapter is vital for a successful managerial career.</para>
<para id="fs-idm300185760"><emphasis effect="bold">Consistent, integrated learning.</emphasis> Targeted learning outcomes are listed at the beginning of each chapter and then repeated throughout the chapter. The learning outcomes connect to the text and the additional resources that accompany <emphasis effect="italics">Organizational Behavior.</emphasis> After reading each section, students can test their retention by answering the questions in the Concept Checks. Every learning goal is further reinforced by a summary at the end of the chapter.</para>
<para id="fs-idm326829152"><emphasis effect="bold">Hundreds of business examples to bring concepts to life.</emphasis> This book is designed to speak to the typical student. We have done a lot of research about student needs, abilities, experiences, and interests, and then we have shaped the text around them. We have used experiences both inside and outside the classroom to create a book that is both readable and enjoyable. We believe that the real applications found throughout every chapter set the standard for readability and understanding of key concepts.</para>
<para id="fs-idm304763472"><emphasis effect="bold">Learning business terminology, made easy.</emphasis> As students begin to study management, they will explore new words and concepts. To help them learn this language, we define each new term in the chapter, display the terms in bold, and offer a complete glossary at the end of the book.</para>
</section>
<section id="fs-idm333010240"><title>Applied Features</title>
<para id="fs-idm334927216">Rather than provide a dry recitation of facts, we illustrate concepts with contemporary examples. In addition to the in-text examples, we have several boxed features that provide more extensive examples in areas of importance in today’s business environment. Each of the boxed features described below includes a series of critical thinking questions to prompt the student to consider the implications of each business strategy.</para>
<para id="fs-idm333091088"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Ethics in Practice.</emphasis></emphasis> Ethics in Practice features demonstrate how businesses are responsible not only to the bottom line, but to providing goods and services in a responsible manner.</para>
<para id="fs-idm304022224"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Managing Change.</emphasis></emphasis> The turbulent business climate requires companies to adapt their business strategies in response to a variety of economic, social, competitive, and technological forces.

<para id="fs-idm340644096"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Catching the Entrepreneurial Spirit.</emphasis></emphasis> This feature highlights the challenges and opportunities available in small businesses and other entrepreneurial ventures.</para>
<para id="fs-idm302503120"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Managerial Leadership.</emphasis></emphasis> It is generally agreed that in a turbulent business climate leadership is an important function of management that helps to maximize efficiency and to achieve organizational goals. Leaders initiate action, motivate organizations, provide guidance, build morale, and create a sense of confidence within the organization and to outside stakeholders.</para>
<para id="fs-idm340173056"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Sustainability and Responsible Management.</emphasis></emphasis> This feature highlights the knowledge, skills, tools, and self-awareness that are needed to become responsible managers. While the area of corporate social responsibility and sustainability has gained wide general support and commentary, these featured boxed items should provide the reader with insights of how managers can embed responsible practices in their careers.</para>
