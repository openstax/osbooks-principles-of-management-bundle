<item>What value do CSR (corporate social responsibility) programs offer to organizations and society?</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm226824800">CSR contributes to another form of self-regulation that goes further and involves firms taking action to help people and the environment. CSR is described as “a belief that corporations have a social responsibility beyond pure profit.” In other words, “Firms are social entities, and so they should play a role in the social issues of the day. They should take seriously their ‘obligations to society’ and actively try to fulfill them.”<cite target-id="ch05rfin-48" id="cite-00001"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="ch05rfin-48">Freeman, R. E. and Gilbert, D. R., Jr. (1988). Corporate strategy and the search for ethics. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.</note></cite> As such, corporations should employ a decision-making process to achieve more than financial success on the assumption that CSR is integral to an optimum long-term strategy.</para>
<para id="fs-idm277745744">In the 21st century, sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) have become strategic imperatives for organizations as fundamental market forces for financial viability and success, where consumers are important stakeholders. Businesses worldwide develop CSR initiatives to become better corporate citizens but also to communicate their activity to both internal and external stakeholders, which may involve a number of groups.</para>
<para id="fs-idm247059728">A study by Horizon Media’s Finger on the Pulse found that “81 percent of Millennials expect companies to make a public commitment to good corporate citizenship.”<cite target-id="ch05rfin-49" id="cite-00002"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="ch05rfin-49">Rudominer, R.

<para id="fs-idm278762448">The 3 P’s (profit, the people, and the planet), or “the triple bottom line” (TBL), is another concept (closely related to and reflective of the mission of CSR and firm activities.<cite target-id="ch05rfin-51" id="cite-00004"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="ch05rfin-51">Elkington, J., Cannibals with Forks, Oxford University Press, 1999.</note></cite> TBL—also known as 3BL—incorporates and assists businesses measure accountability in their funding of and support for social, environmental (ecological), and financial benefits to allow for a greater good. Many corporations have started to add triple bottom line metrics to their business plans in order to evaluate their overall performance and reflect on how companies are contributing to society. A small sample of contemporary CSR initiatives make a difference. For example:</para>

<item>The 3MGives corporation funded $67 million in 2016 to focus on community and the environment, along with educational initiatives boosting student interest in science and technology.</item>
<item>Apple was named by the environmental organization Greenpeace as the “greenest tech company in the world” for over three years because that firm’s packaging is manufactured with 99 percent recycled paper products.</item>
<item>Walt Disney Company’s social mission to strengthen communities states that “by providing hope, happiness, and comfort to kids and families who need it most”. The Walt Disney Company donated more than $400 million to nonprofit organizations in 2016.</item>
<item>Virgin Atlantic’s “Change is in the Air” sustainability initiative states its mission as: “Environment, sustainable design and buying, and community investment.” This firm has since 2007 “reduced total aircraft carbon emissions by 22% and [has] partnered with LanzaTech to develop low carbon fuels for the future.

<para id="fs-idm274875680">Even with the current 2017 U.S. government’s executive branch and Congress backing out of international climate change agreements to expand and promote fossil fuel production, taking actions to disable the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), and not funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, many corporations continue practicing CSR and 3BL principles to support sustainable environmental goals and objectives.<cite target-id="ch05rfin-53" id="cite-00006"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="ch05rfin-53">Friedman, Z.

<para id="fs-idm272938160">While CSR is not a cure-all that can or will significantly make a difference in ushering in more sustainable environmental practices, help alleviate poverty, and use profits to help lower-income communities, it contributes to both internal and external stakeholder awareness to “do the right thing.” For example, Teng and Yazdanifard argue and present evidence that some consumers do take CSR into account while making purchase decision. Also, CSR initiatives and actions have been shown to positively influence both internal and external stakeholders.<cite target-id="ch05rfin-54" id="cite-00007"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="ch05rfin-54">Teng, D. and R.

It was found that employee behaviors matter, as organizations that are well regarded in the community attract greater external loyalty, have more stable revenues, and face fewer crisis risks. A positive relationship with staff in organizations through CSR policies will not only attract better employees, it will also influence the morale, motivation, and loyalty of existing staff. The effective delivery of CSR initiatives also depends on how responsive employees are. If companies wish to achieve legitimacy by operating within a society’s ethical expectations, they must also communicate internally to ensure that CSR activities are integrated into the organizational culture—they cannot “talk the talk” without “walking the walk.”<cite target-id="ch05rfin-55" id="cite-00008"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="ch05rfin-55">Menichini, T. and Rosati, F., “The Strategic Impact of CSR Consumer-Company Alignment”, Procedia- Behavioral and Social Sciences, 109 ( 2014 ) 360 – 364, and Becker-Olsen and Hill, “The impact of perceived corporate social responsibility on consumer behavior”, Journal of Business Research, 59 (1) (2006), pp. 46-53.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-idm274284384">So, does CSR benefit the companies that practice such measures? A meta-analysis of 52 studies with a sample size of 33,878 observations suggested that “corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and, to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility, is likely to pay off. . . . CSP [corporate social performance] appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP [corporate financial performance] than with market-based indicators, and CSP reputation indices are more highly correlated with CFP than are other indicators of CSP” . Many business scholars do believe that some of these relationships are positive.<cite target-id="ch05rfin-56" id="cite-00009"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="ch05rfin-56">Orlitzky, O, F.

And almost no large public company today would want to be seen unengaged in CSR. That is clear admission of how important CSR might be to their bottom line, no matter how difficult it may be to define CSR and link it to profits.”<cite target-id="ch05rfin-57" id="cite-00010"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="ch05rfin-57">Robbins, R.

<para id="fs-idm263819328">Without exception, the managers articulated the importance of communicating CSR initiatives and policy to their employees, as well as recognizing the need to improve their CSR internal communication strategies. According to the managers, CSR initiatives are promoted to create better corporations and a more ethical business environment. These included recycling, carpooling, staff development, and social activities. External initiatives included volunteering, fund-raising, and charitable donations.</para>

<para id="fs-idm259943808">CSR and <term id="term-00001">stakeholder management</term> are complementary approaches.

<para id="fs-idm255274992">The ethical dimension of stakeholder theory is based on the view that profit maximization is constrained by justice, that regard for individual rights should be extended to all constituencies who have a stake in a business, and that organizations are not only “economic” in nature but can also act in socially responsible ways. To this end, companies should act in socially responsible ways, not only because it’s the “right thing to do,” but also to ensure their legitimacy.<cite target-id="ch05rfin-60" id="cite-00013"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="ch05rfin-60">Weiss, J.W.

It appeared that the leadership and culture at BP had been lax and out of touch with its stakeholders—and stockholders. As a consequence, the machinery and equipment were dated and not optimally functioning. One consequence is that employees, workers, communities, and the public may not have suffered that crisis and the continuing after effects.</para>
